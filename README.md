**Based on a project by Laura Owens**

To build this project you'll need to download Java, (I'm using Version 1.8.0_201 but newer versions here should work https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html#JDK8).
You'll also need a IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.
You'll then need to get Maven which can be a little tricky @ https://maven.apache.org/
Once those are all installed you should be able to clone this project using Git fairly easily.
